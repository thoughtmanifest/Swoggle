* Swoggle notes
- AppDelegate - main app runner

- hover, tap option to get declaration and description of class

** In storyboard
- change custom class to swoggleviewcontroller
- click on view, change to boggleview

** Control + click + drag buttons to view

- Swift Protocols are contracts, similar to interface

protocols references need to be weak, otherwise protocols and observers will never be garbage collected.
